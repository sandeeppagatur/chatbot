torch is required as backend for transformers and sentence-transformers.

faiss-cpu for similarity search.

scikit-learn for cosine similarity calculation in deduplication.


# Context-Aware Sentiment Chatbot with Deduplication

This is a simple Flask-based chatbot application that:
- Uses a **retriever** with FAISS and Sentence Transformers to fetch relevant context based on user queries and selected categories.
- Performs **sentiment analysis** on combined user input and retrieved context.
- Removes **duplicate and near-duplicate documents** before indexing to improve retrieval quality.
- Optionally can be extended to use generative models for richer replies.

## Features

- Dynamic context retrieval based on user query + category.
- Duplicate and near-duplicate detection and removal in documents.
- Sentiment analysis with Hugging Face Transformers.
- Simple web UI with category selection and chat interface.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare your documents in data/docs.txt, one context line per entry.

Running the app

python app.py
Open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000

Notes
You can adjust the duplicate detection threshold in app.py (filter_similar_docs function).

For better responses, integrate a generative model (like flan-t5 or OpenAI GPT) in the /analyze route.

For large datasets, consider persisting the FAISS index to avoid rebuilding every run.
